<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Create our Resources</h2>

</p>
<p>
- Create a Resource Group in Microsoft Azure. 
- Create the Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM).
- While creating the VM, select the previously created Resource Group
- While creating the VM, allow it to create a new Virtual Network (Vnet) and Subnet
- Create another VM with Linux (Ubuntu).
- While create the VM, select the previously created Resource Group and Vnet
- Observe Your Virtual Network within Network Watcher

<h2>Observe ICMP Traffic</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>

- Use Remote Desktop to connect to your Windows 10 Virtual Machine
- Within your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, Install Wireshark
- Open Wireshark and filter for ICMP traffic only
- Retrieve the private IP address of the Ubuntu VM and attempt to ping it from within the Windows 10 VM
- Observe ping requests and replies within WireShark
- From The Windows 10 VM, open command line or PowerShell and attempt to ping a public website (such as www.google.com) and observe the traffic in WireShark
- Initiate a perpetual/non-stop ping from your Windows 10 VM to your Ubuntu VM
- Open the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using and disable incoming (inbound) ICMP traffic
- Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line Ping activity
- Re-enable ICMP traffic for the Network Security Group your Ubuntu VM is using
- Back in the Windows 10 VM, observe the ICMP traffic in WireShark and the command line Ping activity (should start working)
- Stop the ping activity


<h2>Observe SSH Traffic</h2>

</p>
<p>
  
- Back in Wireshark, filter for SSH traffic only
- From your Windows 10 VM, “SSH into” your Ubuntu Virtual Machine (via its private IP address)
- Type commands (username, pwd, etc) into the linux SSH connection and observe SSH traffic spam in WireShark
- Exit the SSH connection by typing ‘exit’ and pressing [Enter]

<h2>Observe DHCP Traffic</h2>

<p>

</p>
<p>
  
- Back in Wireshark, filter for DHCP traffic only
- From your Windows 10 VM, attempt to issue your VM a new IP address from the command line (ipconfig /renew)
- Observe the DHCP traffic appearing in WireShark
